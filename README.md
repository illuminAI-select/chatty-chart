# Chatty Chart

An interactive sales tool that visually demonstrates the hidden value in your clients' unanalyzed communication data—especially audio channels like calls.

## The Problem

Most organizations analyze only a tiny fraction of their communication data. While they may review emails and chat messages, **45% of business communication happens over calls**—and typically only 5% is analyzed. That means **95% of valuable customer insights are invisible**.

## What This Tool Does

Chatty Chart creates a powerful visual demonstration for clients, showing them exactly what they're missing:

- **The Iceberg Effect**: Just like an iceberg, most of your data is hidden below the surface
- **Channel-by-Channel Breakdown**: See the gap between data volume and analytics coverage
- **Interactive Exploration**: Let clients adjust the numbers to match their reality
- **Instant Impact**: The grid visualization makes the "missing data" problem undeniable

## Features

- **Mobile-First Design**: Present on any device during client meetings
- **Interactive Controls**: Let clients adjust their actual channel percentages
- **Visual Grid Display**: 10,000 squares showing analyzed vs. unanalyzed data
- **Quick Presets**: Demonstrate different analytics coverage scenarios (10%-100%)
- **Real-Time Updates**: Show the immediate impact of improved analytics coverage
